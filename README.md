Hello!.. This is the Online Voting System by Ancheta and San Miguel.

First of all for the Pie Chart and Password Hashing to work in our system, you need to install these python dependencies and libraries:
#   pip install argon2-cffi
#   pip install matplotlib

You can enter these command on your command prompt/powershell like this:

If you already installed the given dependencies and libraries, we can continue the guide.

**Step 1:** Run the main.py on any IDE that can run python.

**Step 2:** Input "admin" in the username and "admin123" in the password input box to log in as the admin.

**Step 3:** Go to "Manage Candidates"

**Step 4:** You can Add Candidate names of your choosing(there will be existing candidates), you can add multiple just make sure to add a comma "," in between the candidates.
**Optional:** You can remove some already existing candidates if you peek at the candidates.txt file or simply reset the entire list and add new ones.
    
**Step 5:** Once you're done managing the candidates, you can go back to the Admin's Menu and Logout so you can proceed to log in as a voter/user

**Step 5.1:** There is a "Show/Hide Results" button in the Admin's Menu where you can either make the results visible or not to the users. This is always hidden at first so if you want to see the results, before leaving the Admin's Menu toggle the Button and a message box will appear saying the results are now visible.

**Step 6:** If you're now back at the Login page, press the "Register Now" button below the "Login" Button and input your username and password. (There will also be existing users)

**Step 7:** Once logged in as a user, you can now cast a vote for a candidate of your choosing by searching their names. Once you have already searched their name, click on their name below the search bar and then press vote.

**Step 8:** Once you already voted, you can now be able to see the election results(as long as you toggled the visibility button as instructed in Step 5.1). You will see a pie chart and the percentage of each candidate that has a vote.

**Step 9:**  And that's it, you can now use our Online Voting System. Thank for using our application!
